/*
Package arithmetic provides arithmetic operations for any type.

The four elemental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division) are defined as functions with their short names (Add, Sub, Mul and
Div). Other helper functions are provided too. Since there are some data types
without an arithmetical representation, some rules are applied during the value
extraction (see GetVal).
